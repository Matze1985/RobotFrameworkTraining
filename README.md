# RobotFrameworkTraining


## Section 1


### Lecture 1.1 - Introduction

Robot framework is a open source test automation framework written in python. The beauty of this framework is that you need not learn any language like java ,C# or python because it has simple plain text syntax. And instead of writing complicated code, you need to use pre-written functions. It can be extended easily with huge amount of libraries in python or java.

Robot Framework is operating system and application independent. It supports both Python 2 and Python 3, and runs also on Jython (JVM), IronPython (.NET) and PyPy.



### Key features

* open-source

* python based automation framework

* keyword driven

* extends support for web, device, api and database automation

* operating system independent

### What is Selenium?

Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that.
