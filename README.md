### Introduction

Robot framework is a open source test automation framework written in python. The beauty of this framework is that you need not learn any language like java ,C# or python because it has simple plain text syntax. And instead of writing complicated code, you need to use pre-written functions. It can be extended easily with huge amount of libraries in python or java.
